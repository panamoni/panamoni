# Hi, I'm - **Panamoni!**

## About Me

I'm a self-learner. Have explored many different fields. So far I'm stuck on these right now:

* ### 💻 Coding
  * Doing some golang backend dev right now
  * Also working on my per**ssssss**onal Python projects
  * And trying to fit in some C++ native application development
* ### 🎵 Music
  * I play 🎹 piano, 🎸 guitar, and ukulele(couldn't find the emoji for that😶)
  * Also do 🎻 orchestral composing
* ### 🎬 Filming/Cinematography
  * So far I've finished 🎥 2 short films, so I guess that's some sort of accomplishment...😏

## Currently Learning

A LOT - of EVERYTHING.

## Future Plans/Goals

No plans. Just a bunch of goals.
